Because costs are often lower and admission is more open at two-year colleges, many students begin their college careers here. If you plan to start at a community or junior college and later transfer to a four-year college, you should make sure your community college courses will transfer to those colleges you are interested in and that your courses will count toward your bachelors degree. Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year colleges under which the course work taken at the community college transfers into the four-year degree program. Be sure to ask about the types of articulation agreements the community college has, with whom, and for what programs of study."

What major or minor am I most interested in?; What top three extracurricular activities would the ideal college have for me?; What additional features would the ideal college for me have (e.g. writing center, math center, honor code, learning support center, access to a particular religious community)?; What kinds of people do I like spending time with or want to spend time with in college?

At most colleges, you don't have to choose a major until the end of your sophomore year. Until then, you can take courses in a variety of fields. Youll earn general education credits that count toward your degree, no matter what you major in. As you take different classes, youll probably find a subject area you love. On the other hand, you should know that some majors, especially in career-oriented fields like engineering and design, require lots of courses that have to be taken in order. Starting one of those majors after your freshman year can mean that it takes you longer to complete your degree.
